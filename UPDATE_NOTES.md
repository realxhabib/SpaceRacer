# Space Racer - Update Notes

## Changes Made Based on User Feedback

### 1. Asteroid Size Adjustment
- Reduced asteroid scale range from 0.5-1.5 to 0.2-0.6
- This makes asteroids less overwhelming and improves gameplay balance

### 2. Ship Orientation Fix
- Rotated ships 180 degrees to face the correct forward direction
- Ships now properly face the direction of travel

### 3. Control Improvements
- Increased movement strength by 50% for more responsive controls
- Enhanced ship tilting effects:
  - More pronounced tilt angles (from 0.1-0.2 to 0.3-0.4 radians)
  - Faster response to input (lerp factor increased from 0.1 to 0.2)
  - Quicker return to neutral position when no input is detected
- These changes make the ship feel more responsive and provide better visual feedback during movement

## Additional Notes
- All original game features remain intact
- Game balance has been improved with these adjustments
- Controls should now feel more intuitive and responsive
